# Dotfiles
My basic environment setup.  
Work in progress.  
Always


### Installation
1. git clone repo.  
2. run   ```source ~/.files/install.sh ```
3. the installation stops for the first time (you can enter text in the command line) - **Congrats! you are in the middle of the setup.** 
type **exit+Enter** so the installation will continue.

4. second time the installations stops - the installation truely ended **BUT** you need to **log-out/log-in** for zsh to work.  
5. Finito!
